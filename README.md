# Virus-Game

The virus game is a one player game inspired by Galaga/Space-Invaders. The player is a
civilian whose goal is to arrive at a destination alive by killing all the viruses coming in his way.
He has a limited number of munitions (vaccines) so he needs to catch first-aid kits to recharge
it.
Also be cautious of anti-vax who come from the sides!
When the player kills viruses or anti-vax, he gains points that are added to a score.
The level is completed once the virus cloud is eliminated, and each 5 levels brings new stronger
viruses. Lucky him he has 3 hit points to survive.
The game ends when the player loses all his hit points, or when he completes all 5 levels.
